# shopping-list
HTML Error here was that the `<ul id="shopping-list">` wasn't closed. It didn't have the ending "> I think it happened during troubleshooting because both myself and Jet looked through last week. Careful sticky fingers.
<p>Javascript error was  was the use of '' to contain the string above in function createListItemHtml instead of ``. </p>
<p> The final error I was experiencing was posting it the bootcamp server after having deleted it and because it was being deployed
to this server I was unable to test the code on any browser. Crtainly not through the onscreen browser buttons anyway. The fix
was achieved by re-deploying the project file to the bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/~bhuffman server. </p>
